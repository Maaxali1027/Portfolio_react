# Portfolio React App

A modern portfolio website built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Performance Optimizations

This application has been optimized for performance in several ways:

1. **Reduced Animation Complexity**: Simplified particle animations and reduced the number of particles rendered.
2. **Component Memoization**: Used React.memo and useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
3. **CSS Optimization**: Removed unnecessary transitions and animations, especially those that cause layout thrashing.
4. **Lazy Loading Images**: Implemented image lazy loading with loading placeholders.
5. **Throttled Event Handlers**: Scroll events are throttled to reduce CPU usage.
6. **Vite Build Optimizations**: Configured Vite for optimal production builds with code splitting.
7. **Mobile-specific Optimizations**: Disabled certain animations on mobile devices.

## Future Performance Improvements

For even better performance, consider these additional optimizations:

1. **Code Splitting**: Implement React.lazy and Suspense to load components only when needed.
2. **Image Optimization**: Use next-gen image formats (WebP/AVIF) and implement proper sizing.
3. **Service Worker**: Add a service worker for caching and offline support.
4. **Preload Critical Resources**: Use preload/prefetch for critical assets.
5. **Virtualize Long Lists**: For content-heavy sections, implement virtualization with libraries like react-window.
6. **Web Workers**: Move heavy computations off the main thread using Web Workers.

## Development
